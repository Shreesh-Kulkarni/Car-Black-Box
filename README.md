# Car-Black-Box
An Embedded Application developed using PIC16F877A microcontroller which makes extensive use of various peripherals and protocols of a advanced microcontroller to design a black-box system similar to what we observe in aeroplanes but implemented in cars or any other land vehicle.

# NOTE
1. This is my final project submission for my internship at Emertxe Information Technologies.
2. The individual source files for peripherals have already been uploaded to my other repositories,[PIC16F877A](https://github.com/Shreesh-Kulkarni/PIC16F877A-Programming) , [I2C-Communication](https://github.com/Shreesh-Kulkarni/Communication-Protocol) and [Timer/Interrupts](https://github.com/Shreesh-Kulkarni/Timer-Interrupt-Programming)
3. The project was implemented using the following software tools:-
